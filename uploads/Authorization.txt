**** Authorization **** 
Authorization : Technical term 
what you are authorized to use,how much permission user's have given to use & it depends on his role.
for eg : Admin have permission to monitor user's activity. 


1. Authorization is based on token's & for that we need to JWT- JSON Web token (library).

2. JWT - Json web token is the most common way to generate & verifying token's
       - JWT token's can be send on the web & used on the web. 	

   Oauth - It is also one another method to generate & authorize token's. 

3. To Install JWT library -> npm install jsonwebtoken. 

4. Session concept is no more used in today's Web development , so we have to used token's insted of session. 
	if user is login or logout will identify based on token's & not based on session.
